**`Lifetime Learner (First Responder, Engineer, Developer)`**
  
I'm a volunteer first responder by choice, chemical engineer by trade, and lifetime learner by my passion for solving problems. All coding projects are built from the ground up, from planning and designing all the way through solving real-world challenges using code. I'm looking forward to roadmapping my coding journey.

 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª Maroon Platoon's Coding Journey </h3></summary>
<p>While registering for classes during my chemical engineering undergraduate degree, I realized I needed to fill an elective. The only one that fit into my schedule of classes, research, and volunteering was an entry level computer science class. I thought "Why not?" and signed up for an entry level programming class in Java.</p>
  <p>As someone with a lifelong passion for learning, I quickly became interested in learning all I could in the OOP class. Intent on puting the course material to proactice, I began building a game in Unity while learning C#. When the class ended, my coding went on the backburner as I focused on finishing college and completing a masters degree in engineering. Now that I've settled into a career, I'm revisting my passsion for coding through learning python and it's applications with data science. I'm excited to continue my passion for lifelong learning and leverage the skillset I build to grow my career.</p>
